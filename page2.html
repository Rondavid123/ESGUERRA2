<li>A bungalow house design can be your greatest option if you 
adore the charm of Craftsman house plans and have a little land. 
<li>Bungalow floor plans are frequently straightforward, condensed, 
and wider than they are tall. 
<li>Additionally, bungalow house plans often have low-slung rooflines and broad front porches (or stoops) 
supported by paired or tapered columns, just like their Craftsman 
relative. 
<li>These little home plan designs (or "small-ish") are 
typically one or one and a half stories, and (normally) 
cost-effective. 
<li>They are perfect for small urban or narrow lots. 
<li>Bungalow house plans often have open floor plans with few hallways 
and rooms arranged for ease of access, making the most of their 
available space. 
<li>These home plan ideas feel light and airy thanks 
to the numerous windows that let in natural light, and the useful 
built-ins that maximize space. 
<li>Our collection of bungalow house designs is sure to make you feel right at home with floor layouts 
suitable for all types of households.

<h2> What Is a Floor Plan? </h2>
      <p>A floor plan is a sort of drawing that depicts a home or 
other property's layout from above. Typically, floor plans 
show where walls, windows, doors, and stairs are located in 
addition to fixed installations like kitchen cabinets, 
bathroom fixtures, and appliances. Room kinds, room sizes, 
and wall lengths are typically shown on floor plans, which 
are typically drawn to scale. They might also display 
furniture arrangements and incorporate outdoor spaces.</p>
